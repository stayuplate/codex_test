Game Engine

Welcome to the Game Engine repository!
This project is an ongoing effort to build a lightweight yet robust game engine designed for creating simple and fun games. Whether you're a beginner dipping your toes into game development or an experienced developer looking to create small-scale games, this engine is here to help you.
Features

This game engine is under development, but here are some of the features you'll have access to (or can look forward to):

    Cross-platform support: Write your game once and run it across multiple platforms.
    2D Asset Management: Easy integration of sprites, textures, and animations.
    Event System: Handle user input like keyboard and mouse events with minimal boilerplate.
    Physics Engine: Simple 2D physics to handle basic movement, collision detection, and interactions.
    Audio System: Support for background music and sound effects.
    Scene Management: Easily organize and transition between scenes (e.g., menu screens, gameplay, and game-over screens).
    Extensible: Designed with modularity in mindâ€”extend it to add your custom features.

(Note: These features reflect the goals of the project and may not yet all be implemented.)
Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

    C++ (preferred) or another supported programming language
    Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, Microsoft Build Tools, etc.)
    CMake (optional): For building and generating the project, if applicable.
    (Additional dependencies will be listed as needed for specific modules.)

Installation

    Clone the repository:
    bash

git clone https://github.com/your_username/game-engine.git

Navigate into the project directory:
bash

cd game-engine

Build the Engine:
Build instructions will depend on the specific language and tools you're using.
Example (with CMake):
bash

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

    Run an example or test:
    Check the /examples directory for demo projects you can run to see the engine in action.

Usage
Creating Your First Game

To create your game using this engine, you simply need to:

    Set up your game environment: Extend the provided base classes (e.g., GameApp, Scene) to define your game's behavior.

    Design gameplay mechanics: Add and script your game objects using the engine's modular systems (e.g., physics, rendering, audio).

    Run and test your game: Compile and execute your game to bring your ideas to life!

Detailed guides and examples will be provided soon, under the /docs and /examples folders.
Example

Hereâ€™s an example of what a simple "Hello, Game World!" game might look like using our engine (in C++):

C++

#include "GameEngine.h"

class MyGame : public GameApp {
public:
    void OnStart() override {
        // Initialize game objects, load assets, etc.
        AddGameObject(new Player());
    }

    void OnUpdate(float deltaTime) override {
        // Update game logic here.
    }

    void OnRender() override {
        DrawText(100, 100, "Hello, Game World!");
    }
};

int main() {
    MyGame game;
    game.Run();
    return 0;
}

Roadmap

Hereâ€™s a high-level view of upcoming goals and features for this project:

    Implement sprite rendering
    Add event-driven input handling
    Create a basic physics engine (collisions, gravity, etc.)
    Build a UI framework (buttons, labels, etc.)
    Support loading external assets (e.g., JSON-level files, Tiled maps)
    Expand documentation and community resources
